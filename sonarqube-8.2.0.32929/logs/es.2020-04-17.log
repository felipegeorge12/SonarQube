2020.04.17 16:16:03 WARN  es[][o.e.d.i.q.BoolQueryBuilder] Should clauses in the filter context will no longer automatically set the minimum should match to 1 in the next major version. You should group them in a [filter] clause or explicitly set [minimum_should_match] to 1 to restore this behavior in the next major version.
2020.04.17 16:22:57 WARN  es[][o.e.d.c.j.Joda] 'y' year should be replaced with 'u'. Use 'y' for year-of-era.; 'Z' time zone offset/id fails when parsing 'Z' for Zulu timezone. Consider using 'X'. Prefix your date format with '8' to use the new specifier.
